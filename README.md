# Evaluating LLM Systems

In this repo, we work on a example of LLM System evaluation with a single agent with access to a SQL tool. The concepts explored here are derived from [LangSmith](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/concepts/evaluation#agents) and the code was inspired from [this](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/tutorials/Developers/agents) tutorial with some slight code modification and fixes applied to the evaluation procedures.
